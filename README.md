## Objective üìç
Understanding graduate student and employment information in order to achieve data insight  such as
<p> ‚Ä¢ How many students get a job after graduation?
<p> ‚Ä¢ Which type of employment is the student most probable to be hired in?
<p> ‚Ä¢ Which major has the highest employment?
<p> ‚Ä¢ Why do Business majors have the highest employment?
<p> ‚Ä¢ Why do Psychology majors have the highest rate of low-wage employment?

## Dataset üìú
This dataset shows data about graduate students as well as employment information.<p> 
### Reference :page_facing_up:
The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files are a set of untabulated records about individual people or housing units. <p>

## Logic üé≤
Before beginning to create the dashboard, it is necessary to plan and identify the objective of the audience. To clarify my main point, I proceeded with the Logic tree. It contains two main points.

<p> This dataset consists of two groups of data. The first group is an overview of student information. There is information about the total number of students who have graduated, how many people, and gender. The second group is the employment information such as the number of students who work after graduation and the number of students who are unemployed, including information about the type of work such as full-time, or part-time, and information about the relationship between faculty and employment.

## Tools üìè
Power Bi for data visualization

## Dashboard üìä
It's a dashboard that provides users with¬†an overview. It does not give the facts in the way of a business in-depth analysis because the main target audience is the recruiter of the recruiting agency, who is mainly concerned with the first jobber information.

## Insights üí°
<p> 1. How many students get a job after graduation? üìå
<p> From the scorecard on the dashboard, it shows that there are 7 million new graduates, 4 million females, and 3 million males. The number of students who work after graduation is 5 million, and about 400,000 are unemployed. It was seen that the data in the working with unemployment section, when combined, amounted to less than 7 million people. Considering that this is missing data that occurs, for example, not everyone may be able to collect data. Or have continued to study at other levels, so then the information that will go through is the number of students. Employed is 5 million people
<p> 2. Which type of employment is the student most probable to be hired in?üìå
<p> 75% of students who work the most after graduation are full-time. It can be seen that students choose to work full-time rather than part-time, but the other 25% that are part-time may assume that students may choose to work part-time while waiting for a full-time job.
<p> 3. Which major has the highest employment & Why do Business majors have the highest employment?üìå
<p> As for the stacked area chart, in the bottom right chart, it was found that the faculty that got the most jobs was the Business Faculty, with about 1 million people, or equivalent to 20% of the total number of new graduates. This was analyzed by linking to the donut chart above, it was found that the reason why the Faculty of Business was the Faculty that got the most jobs was that business faculty can apply for jobs without having a college degree to apply for any job application. 
<p> That can therefore be seen as working in the business domain of America. Regardless of which faculty graduated from Including may not have a bachelor's degree can apply for this position but may compete with other backgrounds instead, such as works that have been done or projects that have been done Including skills acquired from studying to increase skills according to online courses, all are another part of the factors that are likely to be related to working in the business because in the world right now, knowledge can be obtained from the surroundings. You don't need to go to college to get a degree to apply for a job. 
<p> In this part, this is a supporting reason why business jobs are the ones that do not request the most degrees. Including being the faculty that has the most job opportunities as well this information, if further analyzed, may be found to be useful to the recruiting team in the sense that if looking for people to work in the business team, they can look at the characteristics or qualifications of the candidate that the candidate may not have a degree but we have to talk in terms of skills and work that we have done. It would be useful to recruit more people to join the team because sometimes a talented candidate may not have a guaranteed degree. Therefore, the team may miss the opportunity to select the most suitable person to work with.
<p> 4. Why do Psychology majors have the highest rate of low-wage employment?üìå
<p> It was found that the faculty of Psychology received the highest rate of minimum wage. That's an annual salary of $48000 compared to other faculties that earn a minimum rate of $35K per year. The information that supports this part is in the chart above, which shows that the scientific or medical, such as the Faculty of Nursing, Faculty of Psychology, and Faculty of Biology, is a field that requires a degree or professional certificate to apply for a job, which is a matter that makes sense because if working in the field of medicine or science that is about the natural truth it should be studied according to the textbooks that are specifically directed to come directly to this work.
<p> In summary, the focus of this dashboard is to highlight the relationship between work and faculty that can help audiences see potential trends in terms of employing new graduates. Including helping to plan the selection method and selecting candidates in the early stages.
